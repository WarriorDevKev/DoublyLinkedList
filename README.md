# DoublyLinkedList

We did this by:

• Using our Node class to hold the data and links between nodes <br>
• Implementing a DoublyLinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes <br>
• Creating an instance of our list, and using the .printList() method to track the changes we made <br>

Collaboration w/ Terrence McGowin
